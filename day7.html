 <p id="AA"; style="background-color: bisque; color: brown;">You can’t read much about the risks of advanced AI without soon coming across the paperclip maximizer thought experiment.
     First put forward by the Swedish philosopher Nick Bostrom in his 2003 paper “Ethical Issues in Advanced Artificial Intelligence,” the thought
      experiment goes like this: Imagine an artificial general intelligence (AGI), one essentially limitless in its power and its intelligence. 
      This AGI is programmed by its creators with the goal of producing paperclips. (Why would someone program a powerful AI to create paperclips? 
      Don’t worry about it — the absurdity is the point.)</p>
<p style="background-color: aqua; color:mediumblue; font: arial;">Because the AGI is superintelligent, it quickly learns how to make paperclips out of anything. And because the AGI is superintelligent, it can anticipate and foil any attempt to stop it — and will do so because its one directive is to make more paperclips. Should we attempt to turn the AGI off, it will fight back because it can’t make more paperclips if it is turned off — and it will win, because it is superintelligent.
</p>
<p style="background-color: tomato;">The final result? The entire galaxy, including you, me, and everyone we know, has either been destroyed or been transformed into paperclips. (As AI arch-doomer Eliezer Yudkowsky has written: “The AI does not hate you, nor does it love you, but you are made out of atoms which it can use for something else.”) End thought experiment.</p>
